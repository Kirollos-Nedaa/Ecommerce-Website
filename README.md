<h1>THIS WEBSITE IS NOT HOSTED OR EVEN FULLY FUNCTIONAL IT IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ONLY!!</h1>
Over the past couple of months, I have worked hard on this project, and while it's far from finished, I wanted to share the progress I've made and the knowledge I've gained. I'm now able to build a decent UX/UI interface, link it with a database, and add simple functionality to the site.
<br><br>
So far, I've created a "user" database with a registration and login form (shown in the pictures below). Additionally, I've added a "product" database with an inventory management system that displays four variables: 'Product Name', 'Price', 'Stock Quantity', and 'Product Image'. I also implemented three stock status cases based on quantity:<br>
"In Stock"<br>
"Only [number from 5 to 1] left in stock"<br>
"Out of Stock"<br><br>

I was able to achieve all of this thanks to the Information Technology Institute (ITI).

<h3>How to install and run the site locally:</h3>

Step 1 : download all the files and make sure they are all in a folder called "Projectt"<br><br>
Step 2 : you have to download a local hosting server like XAMP or WAMP for Windows.<br><br>
Step 3 : you will have MYSQL by default so just import the 2 tables included in the "database" folder and make sure you create 2 databases the first will be "products" and import the "inventory.sql" table to it and the second will be called "register" and import "users.sql"to it.<br><br>
Step 4 : if you are using XAMP place the "Projectt" folder into "\xamp\htdocs" to access this directory go to where XAMP was installed, and for WAMP place the "Projectt" folder into "\wamp\www"<br><br>
Step 5 : to get to the home page, open any browser and type "localhost/Projectt/Home.php" for XAMP and for WAMP type "localhost/Home.php"
